The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.

Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.

      "body": "\nMy father, Bob Marley, is one of the most known people in the world. I mean, some people feel as if they know him personally, that's how much history is out there, yet there is so much that is unknown. Bob Marley still holds mystery. We all are still learning new things about him, and some people may just be discovering him.\n\nIn this mission we are happy to be partners with Google Arts & Culture to compile and exhibit in one online location the most extensive collection of Bob Marley artifacts. On this great journey we see him, hear his music, we listen to his words, we look at his life and we learn something about him as well as ourselves.\n\nWho is Bob Marley? A fist raised to the air in defiance, a smile that makes you want to smile back, the puff of a spliff amid deep contemplation warning us about the system, inspiring us to stand up for our rights, asking us to help him sing these songs of freedom.\n\nMy father has transcended from being just a musician, an artist, an activist, even a legend. Bob Marley is a symbol for love, justice, equality, freedom and unity to people from all walks of life around the world and with the help from the community of countless fans who have uncovered, preserved and shared endless amount of content, always finding something new. Bob Marley’s legacy continues to live and grow. We have worked to find ways of sifting through the massiveness of it all creating curated experiences that help connect the dots of his legacy while providing new angles of discovery.\n\nIt is a living project that will continue to grow in the coming months and years. Enjoy the journey.",

      "title": "Growing price pressures: On need to tame inflation",
      "body": "Inflation in India continues on a worrying uptrend with the consumer price index-based reading accelerating to an eight-month high of 6.07% last month, while wholesale prices logged a double-digit increase for the eleventh straight month. February’s headline WPI inflation spurted to 13.11%. Retail inflation remained stuck above the RBI’s upper tolerance threshold of 6% for the second month, as food price inflation quickened to 5.85%. Households in the hinterland bore a bigger brunt of the burden as price gains measured by the consumer food price index for rural areas surged by 69 basis points from January’s level, to 5.87%. Price gains in the key protein source of meat and fish jumped by almost 200 basis points from the preceding month to 7.45%, while nutrient-rich vegetables also logged inflation of 6.13% in February, belying the central bank’s prognostication last month of an “expected easing of vegetable prices on fresh winter crop arrivals”. And even though inflation in oils and fats eased by more than 220 basis points to 16.44%, there is little room for cheer, given that one can expect a spike again this month in the wake of the abrupt disruption in the supply of edible oils from war-torn Ukraine, which is the largest source of sunflower oil imported into India. With price gains in clothing and footwear, fuel and light and transport and communication all running well above 8% levels, the overall trend in retail inflation is now clearly broad-based across consumption categories and disconcertingly way above tolerance levels.\n\nAlso, with the pump prices of fuels yet to reflect the recent upsurge in international oil prices in the wake of Russia’s invasion of its southwestern neighbour, transport and communication inflation is certain to climb sharply once state-run refiners reset prices to reflect crude costs. The price of India’s crude basket had already risen by over $20 a barrel since December to $94.07 last month and with global crude prices currently in uncharted territory on account of the war, and the rupee having weakened by about 2.5% against the dollar since the start of the conflict, it is hard to see any near-term relief on the fuel price front. A glance at last month’s producer prices of the energy basket shows inflation in the fuel and power category of the wholesale price index was at 31.5%. And in a sign that manufacturers are no longer able to keep absorbing cost pressures, inflation in manufactured products accelerated to 9.84% presaging more pain for consumers. RBI Deputy Governor Michael D. Patra had last week cited the headroom available for the Government to cut taxes on fuels as a source of comfort on the inflation front. With the RBI’s latest consumer confidence survey showing most households reporting further increases in overall spending on essentials and remaining far from sanguine on the prices outlook, policymakers need to act expeditiously to tame inflation or risk it undermining the very growth they are currently focused on supporting.",

      "title": "White sheen: On India’s staggering dominance in Test cricket",
      "body": "India’s staggering dominance in cricketing jousts at home was further reiterated at the conclusion of the Test series against Sri Lanka. If the earlier T20Is were swept 3-0, the longer format proved no different as the host won at 2-0 with the triumphs in both Tests being registered in three days each. These emphatic victories emphasised the vast gulf in quality between the rivals split by the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. India last failed in a home Test series during 2012 when Alastair Cook’s England prevailed at 2-1. Subsequently for nearly a decade, India proved to be a tough opponent in its backyard, maximising home advantage and thriving on an array of diverse stars who could bat, spin and bowl reverse-swing on dry pitches under a harsh sun. That template was evident through the last fortnight. The positive results may hint at a smooth leadership transition from Virat Kohli to Rohit Sharma but prior to the series, the incumbent had his share of headaches. The middle order was recast with Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane making way for Hanuma Vihari and Shreyas Iyer while an injured opener K.L. Rahul was ruled out. The batting needed reassurance while the losses in South Africa continued to haunt. Those worries were gradually erased as despite Rohit and Kohli’s lukewarm yield, Vihari and Shreyas revealed their mettle.\n\nShreyas was brilliant at Bengaluru’s M. Chinnaswamy Stadium, leaving his imprint on an abrasive surface. The pitch may not have been a minefield like the one on which Sunil Gavaskar scored a masterly 96 in his last Test innings during the game against Pakistan in 1987, and yet it was a strip that never allowed batters to settle. The 92 and 67 from Shreyas were straight from the top-drawer while Ravindra Jadeja’s star turn in the first Test at Mohali, as reflected in his unbeaten 175 and match haul of nine wickets, kick-started India’s campaign. The cameos by Rishabh Pant and the wickets from Jasprit Bumrah and R. Ashwin, together deflated Sri Lanka even if its skipper Dimuth Karunaratne struck a ton at Bengaluru. Importantly, India gained valuable points and moved to the fourth place in the ICC Test Championship table for the 2021-23 cycle. Having lost in the final to New Zealand during the previous edition, Rohit is fully aware of the challenges even if India can breathe easy this year, especially with a major chunk of its Tests being at home before its tour of Bangladesh. There is also a lone Test to tackle in England, a remnant of last year’s tour. While the players will soon blend into the imminent Indian Premier League, their Test whites seem to have gained a fresh sheen.",
